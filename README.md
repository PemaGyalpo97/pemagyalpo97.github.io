GitHub Pages
Websites for you and your projects.
Hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.

Create a repository
Head over to GitHub and create a new public repository named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.

If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.

Clone the repository
Go to the folder where you want to store your project, and clone the new repository

Hello World
Enter the project folder and add an index.html file

Push it
Add, commit, and push your changes

…and you're done!
Fire up a browser and go to https://username.github.io
